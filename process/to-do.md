- ~~Make the board work~~
- ~~Make the AI work~~
- ~~Add HP to pieces~~
- ~~Account for castling and en passant~~
- ~~Think about promotion and HP~~
- ~~Make attacking remove random health~~
- ~~Handle en passant properly~~
- ~~Add PGN/Rogue message~~
- ~~Style it~~
- ~~Add working status bar~~
- ~~__NOT ANYMORE__ Add level-up when you capture a piece (you take its maximum HP? Its current HP?)~~

- Think about the AI's lack of awareness of HP in its tactics
