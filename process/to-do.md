- ~~Make the board work~~
- ~~Make the AI work~~
- ~~Add HP to pieces~~
- ~~Account for castling and en passant~~
- ~~Think about promotion and HP~~
- ~~Make attacking remove random health~~
- ~~Handle en passant properly~~
- ~~Add PGN/Rogue message~~
- ~~Style it~~
- ~~Add working status bar~~
- ~~__NOT ANYMORE__ Add level-up when you capture a piece (you take its maximum HP? Its current HP?)~~

- ~~Think about the AI's lack of awareness of HP in its tactics~~

## Later on after I've written insane amounts of code trying to do the HP stuff

- ~~Seems to be moments where the game freezes up just after an attack - the indicator kind of just sits there and the game hangs until the next move is very suddenly made. Happens after piece animates back. Only seems to affect white attacks? Gets cumulatively worse? (On miss and HP lost)~~
- ~~Need to improve the timing and sounds and so on~~
