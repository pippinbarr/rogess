# Closing statement

How can I write this fucking thing?
- How about: literally a series of (chronological) design and technical moves that led to the final game?
- e.g. We start with the core idea and tech
- And then make a series of significant moves both in theory (email especially) and in implementation, rejecting/keeping things as we go
- Until we reach the final game
- So more like an annotated timeline? Could be an interesting form?


Origin
- Chogue again but with Rogue combat rules, Cherry Chogue
- Literal tweak to Unity
- Exists in the codebase of Chogue

Death and resurrection of simplicity
- Started simple (Rogue combat addition to Chogue world)
  - Issue that in chogue levels with sparse pieces and less frequent combat you can effectively play as a scout (especially since you drag your team with you)
- We complicated things a lot initially to make a more interesting game
- But moved toward the simplest version
- Partly for clarity, partly for balance/design, partly just for work

HP decisions
- King power
- Current HP versus Max HP

AI problems
- Brittle AI (Chogue AI)
- Non-Rogue AI (Chess AI)
- How can you tell if an AI is reasonable? (AlphaZero)
- Two-player for human I

Hybrid game design continues
- Movement to a more "pure" represenation of the idea
- Space and combat
- The need to change the space to respond to the change in combat (semi ironic?)

Process documentation "fail"
- Harder to be systematic with multiple designers
- Social element (not wanting to claim design thinking, issues of agreement)
- Email as a strong medium (or Slack etc.)
- Pre-understanding via Chogue
