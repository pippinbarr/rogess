# Process documentation

This is the process documentation wiki for the game _Rogess_. The process documentation available here is the result of following the [MDMA](http://www.gamesasresearch.com/mdma) (Method for Design Materialisation and Analysis), an approach to game design recoverability that forms the basis of the [Games as Research](http://www.gamesasresearch.com/) project I am part of with [Rilla Khaled](http://www.rillakhaled.com/) and [Jonathan Lessard](https://jonathanlessard.net/).

### [Closing Statement](./closing-statement.md)
A final, hopefully-accessible discussion of the game with hindsight.

### [To Do](./to-do.md)
The todo list of practical tasks for the project.

### [Correspondence](./correspondence.md)
The emails sent between Pippin and Jonathan as Rogess was being designed and developed, functioning as a more detailed process record than the process journal did.

### [Process Journal](./process-journal.md)
A journal that includes high-level reflections on the design and development process, intended to be complementary to the [commit history of the repository](https://github.com/pippinbarr/rogess/commits/master).

### [Related Work](./related-work.md)
Links to texts, images, and other media that are related to this project in some way.

### [Research Questions](./research-questions.md)
Attempts to frame what's meaningful about this project.

### [Press Kit](../press/README.md)
A press kit.
