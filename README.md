_e4! e5! Nf3! Nc6! White knight captures black pawn! Black knight attacks white knight for 2HP of damage! White knight misses black knight! What the hell is going on?!_

Rogess is the shadow-sequel to [Chogue](https://github.com/pippinbarr/chogue/wiki/Press-Kit). Where Chogue set the game of chess in a series of Rogue-like procedurally-generated dungeons, Rogess takes the combat rules of Rogue and applies them to a standard game of chess. Essentially, Rogess answers a fairly simple "what if?" around the mechanics of chess and the spatial environment of Rogue. As with Chogue, this reconfiguration of both games leads to something new and odd and maybe, just maybe, kind of enjoyable.
